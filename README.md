Revised abstract and title 

Started on methodology, including section on a function bisection method works well on 

made 2 plots on the desired bisection function and the iterative progress 

made table recording progress on well-defined bisection problem 

found example of 'stiff ode' that finite difference methods may fail on (still need to find proper citations)
