Revised abstract and title 

Started on methodology, including section on a function bisection method works well on 

made 2 plots on the desired bisection function and the iterative progress 

made table recording progress on well-defined bisection problem 

found example of 'stiff ode' that finite difference methods may fail on (still need to find proper citations)

created section in methodology that expands on the bisection method

created python code and plots invloving Newton's and the bisection method 

Removed section on Quasi-Newton as it did not fit the study well 

Created summary for Fixed Point Iteration method 

Finished methodology for each method, completed plots for good/bad example for each and did writeup on why they did/did not work well

completed results section, created easy jot notes that students can remember from the study 

Completed conclusion and AI declaration, as well as organizing the bibliography 

completed everything
